# uArm
# a simple but complicated robotic arm


  uArm is a 4-axis parallel-mechanism robot arm, inspired by the ABB Pallet Pack industrial robot arm.  uArm is a desktop type robotic arms which is developed for makers, STEM and education purposes. Which is Based on Arduino and of the shelf parts. uArm is open sourced and DIY friendly. It can be used by students to learn robotics, cad modelling, programming, and electronics. It can be used makers to do all cool things e.g., using as third hand when soldering. uArm supports Arduino, Python. No matter what level of a maker you are, you will have a lot of fun learning with uArm.

  The uArm is an Arduino-powered, 4-axis robot arm that has been modelled after
industrial pallet packing and car building robots which can be set up and used straight off
your desktop. Each uArm is equipped with three digital servos to control the basic
movement of the arm and an additional mini servo attached to the end-effector that moves
and rotates the object you are lifting with your chosen manipulator. 


  uArm's hardware can be divided into two main sections upper and lower section.
Upper section consists of upper-Arm, fore-Arm, end-effector as (Fig)
these parts together make movements in the Z-plane. Lower section consists of a geared
dc motor, gearâ€™s, baseplate, servo-baseplate, end-limit switch, lower section together
makes movement in the x-y plane thus we get a 3d workspace. Most of the parts are made
from 3d printing than injection moulding.
